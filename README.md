# TFT AutoHotkey Gamepad Script

I know that TFT Mobile is right around the corner, but I always wanted to be able to play TFT using a gamepad, as it would probably be the comfiest option to play on the couch or in your bed.

## How it will work

### Installation

1. Download and install AutoHotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/download/
2. Download the Script from ... (Work in progress)
3. Launch the Script
4. (Optional) Create a Link in {AutostartDirectory} that links to with `{AutoHotkey File in Installation Directory} {Script}`

### Planned Hotkeys
All bindings are on a Switch Pro Controller (Because it's the best controller don't @ me)
|Key|Function|
|---|---|
|Dpad|Move Mouse to Hexes / Bench Spots / Shop Slots / Items / Reroll / Level (/ Players?)|
|RT|Circle Hexes > Bench > Shop > Items > (Players?) > Hexes > ...|
|LT|Circle in the other direction|
|A|Left Click|
|B|Sell Unit (Relly hesitent to bind this one)|
|X|Level Up|
|Y|Reroll|
|Left Stick|Move Mouse freely|
|Right Stick|Move the Mouse in a circle around the center for the Carusell (outer bounds will be the start barrier)|
|ZR?|Right Click to move|
|Home|Space|

## Disclaimer
The Script will be first and foremost for myself and will be programmed initially to work on a 1440p Monitor with a Swich Pro Controller. Keybinds are easy to edit (Todo write a guide for that) but different Monitor sizes will require to redefine all points (I am not sure if simple scaling will suffice), also HUD Scaling will probably have an effect. Feel free to contribute by forking and sending me a pull request.
